//3.Write a SQL query to Rename the column name.


ALTER TABLE tableName RENAME COLUMN column1 TO column2;

example:
ALTER TABLE employee RENAME COLUMN Name TO EmpName;



//4.Write a SQL query to find duplicate records.

->Duplicate records can be find by using GROUPBY and COUNT function.
->GROUPBY is used to group all the rows and columns to check for duplicates.
->COUNT is used to count the number of times the duplicate values is occured.

example:

selecting ORDERID from the EMPLOYEE_TABLE to find the duplicate values.

SELECT OrderID, COUNT(OrderID)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY OrderID
HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 1

here, if the COUNT is greater than 1, then the duplicate values occured more than once.
